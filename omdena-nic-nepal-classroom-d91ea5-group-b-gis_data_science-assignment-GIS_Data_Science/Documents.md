# GIS Data Science for Climate in Nepal

## Assignment Overview
This project aims to explore climate data for Nepal using GIS (Geographical Information System) techniques. The goal is to assess climate trends, such as temperature and precipitation changes over time, by leveraging GIS data science tools and visualizations. The dataset used in this project includes climate-related GIS data for Nepal for the years 2020 and 2050.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Visualize climate trends** in Nepal by plotting temperature and precipitation data.
2. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to compute basic statistics (mean, median, min, max) of climate variables and identify patterns in the data.
3. **Document the findings** from the analysis and provide insights into how climate change might affect Nepal.

## Data Loading and Preparation

The dataset consists of:

1. **Shape_Data**:
   - `local_unit.shp`: Contains the geographical boundaries of Nepalâ€™s administrative regions.
   - `local_unit.dbf`: Contains the attribute data for each administrative region.
   - `local_unit.prj`: Provides the projection information for the shapefile.
   - `local_unit.sbn` & `local_unit.sbx`: Spatial index files for the shapefile.
   - `local_unit.shx`: Index file for the shapefile geometry.

2. **Nepal Climate Data (Raster Files)**:
   - `nepal_temperature_2020.tif`: Temperature data for Nepal in 2020.
   - `nepal_temperature_2050.tif`: Temperature data for Nepal in 2050.
   - `nepal_precipitation_2020.tif`: Precipitation data for Nepal in 2020.
   - `nepal_precipitation_2050.tif`: Precipitation data for Nepal in 2050.

3. **GeoPackage Data**:
   - `nepal_admin_regions.gpkg`: Contains the administrative boundaries of Nepal.
   - `nepal_glaciers.gpkg`: Contains information on Nepal's glaciers.
   - `nepal_rivers.gpkg`: Contains data on rivers in Nepal.

Data is loaded into Python using `geopandas` for vector data (shapefiles and GeoPackages) and `rasterio` for raster data.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were created:

1. **Nepal Map**:
   - A map showing the **administrative regions** and **rivers** of Nepal.
   
2. **Temperature Trends**:
   - A side-by-side comparison of **temperature** data for 2020 and 2050, visualized using heatmaps.

3. **Precipitation Trends**:
   - A side-by-side comparison of **precipitation** data for 2020 and 2050, also visualized using heatmaps.

4. **Temperature Distribution (2020)**:
   - A histogram with a kernel density estimate (KDE) to visualize the **distribution of temperature** across Nepal for the year 2020.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Temperature and Precipitation Statistics (2020):
The following basic statistics were computed for the temperature and precipitation data for 2020:

- **Temperature 2020**:
  - Mean: `mean_value`
  - Median: `median_value`
  - Min: `min_value`
  - Max: `max_value`
  
- **Precipitation 2020**:
  - Mean: `mean_value`
  - Median: `median_value`
  - Min: `min_value`
  - Max: `max_value`

### Insights and Observations:
- **Temperature Increase**: There is a noticeable increase in temperature from 2020 to 2050 across Nepal. The heatmaps indicate that some regions will experience higher temperature changes.
- **Precipitation Variability**: Precipitation data suggests that certain areas might experience increased rainfall, while others could face reduced precipitation in the future.

## Summary of Findings

From the EDA and visualizations, it is clear that:

1. Nepal is projected to experience significant changes in both temperature and precipitation by 2050.
2. The spatial distribution of temperature and precipitation is uneven across regions, highlighting varying impacts of climate change on different parts of Nepal.
3. This information can aid in climate adaptation strategies for Nepal's various regions, helping policymakers focus on areas most at risk from temperature and precipitation extremes.
